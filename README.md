# Shawn Cockburn's Blog 📚
This is my personal blog.
### Front End 🤔
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
* [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io)
* [Markdown-To-JSX](https://github.com/probablyup/markdown-to-jsx)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

### Back End 😎
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
* [MongooseJS](https://mongoosejs.com)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

Firebase is used only for authentication 🔒 between the front and backend.

#### This repo is the frontend only

## npm start 🏁
Will run the project locally but will pull data from my api still,
to change this navigate to the [API](src/Api/api.js) file.

## Firebase Auth 🔒
To use your own auth navigate to the [API](src/Auth/Auth.jsx) file and follow this [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.auth.Auth) javascript documentation.

## Final word. 👍
This project is intended for my use but you are more than welcome to clone it and hack it into whatever you want!
