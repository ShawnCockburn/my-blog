- Optional: add a little more hot sauce for extra flavor.
- **Enjoy!**

### Notes
If you're cutting and every calorie counts, you could half the rice, add more veggies and only use a little olive oil for cooking the chicken, or even use a low-calorie spray.  
This would bring the macros down to around 40g protein, 50g carbs, 10g fat, and ~450 kcal per serving.

I also like to add some tenderstem broccoli to each container for some extra greens and fiber.
