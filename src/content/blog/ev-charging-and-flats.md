### TL;DR
We need more chargers, especially for people who don't own their own home ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

### Planning Permission... Or Not

To build a new home or really any building you need planning permission in most cases, as someone who has multiple family members try to get planning permission for one project or another it can be a real pain! üò±
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering about my next car and whether to go for an EV or not, I am an EV enthusiast but in my current living situation (living in a flat with shared residential parking) it would be inconvenient to go to a charging station a few times a week and I saw an article that says EV chargers will become mandatory in any new UK homes ([see this article](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/electric-car-chargepoints-to-be-installed-in-all-future-homes-in-world-first)), it would be great if any new shared residential parking had to be built with EV chargers for every 1 out of 5 spaces or even better every space!! ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if new shared residential builds or even existing ones were encouraged to incorporate EV charging into their properties to pass planning permission, EV adoption would be much faster! I'm generalising but most people who might be interested in a budget/short-range city EV more than likely to live in shared residential areas, right?
<br/>
<br/>
Planning permission may not be the best way but maybe something along the lines of cost of doing business (to build the property) or a tax incentive...
<br/>
<br/>
Where I live there are less than 4 charging areas within a 5-mile radius, that's ~1200 people per EV charger in the local area, now 2030 isn't too far away let's hope there are a few more chargers before then, otherwise it's going to be the walking dead over here haha...

### Finally
Ultimately I don't know the answer to this, I am just concerned that we may not have enough chargers for our EV future...
