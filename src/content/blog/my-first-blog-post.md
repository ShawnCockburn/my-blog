#### TL:DR
I was inspired to make this blog website because of [Zoella](https://zoella.co.uk).

#### A little background.
Over Christmas, I have been looking for a project or something I can build in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org), 

a couple of days ago I saw my girlfriend looking at [Zoella's](https://zoella.co.uk) blog, instantly an idea had sparked... why don't I build my own blog? I mean I want to write more as its something I rarely do, plus it'll allow me to use/learn several technologies. for example 
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
* [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io)
* [Markdown-To-JSX](https://github.com/probablyup/markdown-to-jsx)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
* [MongooseJS](https://mongoosejs.com)

I was inspired by the design of the [Zoella](https://zoella.co.uk) blog but I wanted to make something more minimalistic as I found the vibe of the site a little busy.

Before jumping into the coding I made a quick design in Adobe XD to guide my design decisions.

So that's roughly why and how I started this, hopefully, future posts will be a little more interesting...


#### Finally.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to blog about, however, I can say it'll be anything from shower thoughts to geeking out about tech; I don't want a single theme...
