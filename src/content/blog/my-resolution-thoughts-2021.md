### TL:DR
New year's resolutions are rarely followed through and my resolution is to be more social... whatever that means.

### New Years Resolutions

As with every new year, most of us have something we would like to improve about ourselves, usually along the lines of *"loose 5kg"* or *"learn french"* or something lofty like that...
<br>
<br>
I think I heard on the [Not Overthinking](https://open.spotify.com/show/1Zo2yYgEYWRRpF2jTcNP5R) podcast that setting specific targets could be problematic if you want to achieve a goal, as they are too large for us to see immediate results so eventually, after a week or two our brains tell us any excuse to skip one day, then that day turns in to three days and eventually, you forgot that you even had a goal.

### My Resolution

So this year I'm keeping it real simple, my new year's resolution this year is to
**be more social**.ðŸ¤”
<br>
Now I know what your thinking: *What about Coronavirus fam, how are going to be more social?*
<br>
<br>
Well, for now, I guess I'm just going to reach out to friends more via the internet but later this year I really just want to meet new people and old friends just because.
<br>
<br>
This is probably a byproduct of a whole year of basically not seeing anyone but I also feel like I'm changing slightly as a person, whereas in the past I might have shied away from such occasions, now I want to be social.
<br>
I don't really know where I'm going with this but oh well

### 2021
Happy new year!ðŸŽ‰ Here's to a better year than 2020
