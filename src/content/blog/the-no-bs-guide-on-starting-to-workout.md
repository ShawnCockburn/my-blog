Based on my fitness/gym journey, here's everything you need to know.

## Preface
I have included a [glossary at the end of this article](#glossary). I will be using terms that some may not be familiar with. Please refer to it if you are unsure what a word means.

## Timeframe
You are not going to see changes in hours or days; you will see them in weeks, months and most importantly... years.

Don't be disheartened by this truth; it means the changes you do see are all the more rewarding!

Anyone who tells you otherwise is likely trying to sell you snake oil. 

## How to start
I'm going to split this into three options.

### 1. Easy and home only
Many of us simply start at home, with our own body weight. This is called Callisthenics, it's a great intro on how to work out, you can get familiar with your body and the concepts of reps, sets and progressive overload, etc...

You could then level this up to a very versatile home workout with a pair of simple 10kg dumbbells and resistance bands.

If your goal is to feel healthier and see a mild but noticeable change in the way you look, then this is all you need!

For these types of workouts, there are many YouTube follow along videos. The one I'd recommend looking at is [youtube.com/@madfit](https://www.youtube.com/@MadFit) she has plenty of easy to follow videos.

Remember to note down in each set how many reps you achieved and then try to beat it by at least 1 in your next workout! This is progressive overload.

### 2. App guided gym
You can progress from the home only workouts to this, or just start here.
I personally do not use an app, but here's a list of apps I have heard good things about:
- https://www.pushapp.co.uk/
- https://rpstrength.com/pages/hypertrophy-app
Do your own research before committing to one.

This option is good for those who want a super easy way to start and are willing to get a gym membership.

### 3. Personal trainer (PT) + Gym
This is the option I'd recommend the most for those who want to start but don't have a clue.

Find a local trainer, discuss your goals and they will show you how to correctly perform exercises with good technique and form to maximise results and prevent injury.

A trainer will create a workout plan that fits your goals and requirements.

Make sure to ask lots of questions and clarify anything you don't understand with them.

For the above reasons, this is a fantastic way to kickstart your workout journey!

## What to expect?
Is it a walk in the park?

### Why are my arms spaghetti?
For your first few workouts, you are going to feel like your muscles and joints are all separate elements that you have to think hard about controlling, Movements feel perhaps unnatural or disjointed, a bit like riding a bike for the first time, this stage passes quickly, and your body learns to Just do it™️.

### Ouch
Soreness is very normal and it's the most intense after the first workout, it very quickly fades until you actually feel satisfaction when there is some soreness after a workout.

Novel exercise on any untrained person is going to suck the next day. The first time my girlfriend tried bicep curls, she was walking around like a T. rex for a day or two, haha.

Don't avoid working out just because it sucked the first time, I promise it does not suck for longer than the first/second time.
That being said, if you feel a sharp or unpleasant pain during an exercise, then stop immediately.

### Where are my gains?
[Remember timeframe..?](#timeframe) This whole thing takes time, compare yourself to yourself last month/quarter/year.
Trust the process, progress is happening, one day you will look in the mirror and be like: Wow, I can see individual muscles, and are those abs???

## Tracking progress
This is pretty simple, really.

1. Take a photo of yourself with neutral lighting and background every two months or quarter in the following arrangement: Front, side and back; [this is a great guide](https://www.mypthub.net/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-progress-pics/)
2. Using a notebook, note app, or dedicated workout tracking app, note down every set you complete, note the weight, the reps you achieved and maybe some extra info such as how you are feeling or how a piece of equipment was configured.
   
## Outside the gym
What about when you're not working out...

### Nutrition
It's not the scope of this article to educate you on specific nutrition for your goal, but here's two simple goals for you:
- Eat more protein, I guarantee you're not eating enough.
Aim for 120g to 150g of predominantly animal based protein (Meat, milk, eggs, etc...) with a mix of other sources too.

> Note: if you can't eat meat, then make sure you get a high quality vegan protein powder and eat lots of protein containing foods.

- Eat more whole foods, you don't have to stop eating McDonald's, but try to get most of your food from high quality sources such as veg, meats and grains. ([see my previous post for an example](/easy-shredded-chicken-and-fluffy-rice-meal-prep))

### Sleep
This is very important: bad sleep = no gains.

Let me say it again: NO SLEEP = NO GAINS.

Sleep is the most important factor in recovery.

Here's a simple formula:
- Go to bed at the same time every day
- Sleep for 7-9 hours (you should wake feeling refreshed)
- Curtail any stimulating activities 1 hour before bed (cardio/phone/raving)

You don't need to be perfect; we are human after all, and life does get in the way.

## Suppliments
TLDR: most of it is snake oil, here's what matters:
- Protein powder: high quality whey protein is more than enough. [This is what works for me](https://www.theproteinworks.com/whey-protein-360-extreme).
- Creatine monohydrate: take 5-10g every day after food. [This is what works for me](https://www.theproteinworks.com/creatine-monohydrate). Buy in bulk, don't be tempted by other forms of creatine; it's just more expensive and does the same thing. 
- Multivitamins, literally the cheapest multivitamin from your local supermarket will do, take it after food, it absorbs better.
The best part is they are all optional, take 'em if you need or want them.

Remember, they are supplements, not replacements...

## How often should I workout?
Three times a week consistently, more if you want.

## How hard should I be working out
If you're unsure, then a general rule is as follows:
- To failure
If you're able to do more than 20 reps before failing, then up the weight, but as long as you can do at least 5 good form reps, then you are golden!

## General rules
- On the lowering part of a rep (known as the eccentric), ie the part where you are going back to the initial resting position: control the eccentric, don't just drop the weight, you make more gains by controlling the eccentric and won't injure yourself. 2 seconds is fine.
- Consistency is king.
- The goal is progressive overload; you should always feel challenged   💪.
- Don't mix cardio and strength training in the same session, but on the same day is fine.

## Won't people judge me at the gym?
No one gives two shits about what you're doing, like you, they are worried that others are judging them, or they are just focused on their own workout.

In my experience, most people are friendly or apathetic.

## Quality content
Most influencers are there to sell you something by means of deceit.
Here are a few worth their salt:
- [youtube.com/@RenaissancePeriodization](https://www.youtube.com/@RenaissancePeriodization)
- [youtube.com/@JoeDelaneyy](https://www.youtube.com/@JoeDelaneyy)
- [youtube.com/@JeffNippard](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffNippard)

## TLDR
Consistently:
- Go to the gym
- Challenge yourself
- Eat well
- Sleep well

## Finally
I probably missed several things, left you with more questions than answers and have not convinced you that the gym is fun. Any Q's, feel free to contact me via the methods listed on my website: [shawncockburn.co.uk](https://shawncockburn.co.uk)

## Glossary
- **Rep:** short for repetition, this means one full contraction of the target muscle, eg, raising your arms from your side to over your head and back to your side.  
- **Set:** a set is an amount of reps for a given exercise, eg, performing 10 reps of push-ups is one set.  
- **Failure:** the point in a set where you cannot complete another rep with proper form.  
- **Progressive overload:** gradually increasing the weight, reps, or sets over time to continually challenge muscles and stimulate growth.  
- **Hypertrophy:** an increase in muscle size as a result of consistent strength training.  
- **Form:** the correct technique and body alignment used during an exercise to maximise effectiveness and minimise injury risk.  
- **Recovery:** the period after exercise when your body repairs muscles, replenishes energy stores, and adapts to training.  
- **Deload:** a planned reduction in training intensity, volume, or both, usually lasting about a week.  
- **Callisthenics:** a form of training that uses bodyweight exercises instead of external weights. Examples include push-ups, pull-ups, dips, squats, and planks.
