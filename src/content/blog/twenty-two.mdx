### TL:DR
Last year felt short, I want to cook an over-complicated dish and something about Henry Cavill...

## 2020

*not too much gloom I promise*
<br/>
<br/>
Last year seems so short, I mean personally not much happened and that's a good thing, right?
<br/>
Well yes but to give some context, a lot happened in the raging dumpster-fire of 2020 *(I need not reiterate you know what happened)*,
<br/>
but I still feel like last year was short, time for more context:
<br/>
<br/>
Just after my twenty-first birthday, I had high hopes for the year ahead and I totally should have you know... I had just moved into an apartment with my girlfriend of at that point over three years.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is getting a bit rambly so the point is I only achieved some of what I wanted to last year, don't get me wrong I did achieve some big things but not as many as I had hoped. Now let's move on üëâ

### Low Key

No not this geez...

What am I chatting then??
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm *low key* excited for this year of twenty-two, why you may ask?
<br/>
Here are some of the things I'm looking forward to:

- Rona buggering off. *(I hope)*
- The Witcher season 2. *(obviously totally not just because Henry Cavill's biceps)*
- My girlfriend finishing uni and launching into her career.
- HOLIDAY somewhere, anywhere... maybe Italy üçï or perhaps France ü•ê. *(Permitting my first point)*
- Friends. *([See my previous blog post](https://blog.shawncockburn.co.uk/my-resolution-thoughts-2021))*
- Improving my home office.
- Building a shelf/cabinet for all my miscellaneous stuff and my home server.
- Decorating it more, I painted one feature wall but I wanna add some more character to the room, make it more inviting.
- Improve my bouldering skills üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
- Cooking new things!
- I met up with a mate recently and it turns out he loves to cook, he mentioned he has this Italian sauce that he's been perfecting over the last year; it apparently takes several hours to make. now I love cooking and especially Italian dishes but I don't usually spend over an hour-ish doing it, however this year I wanna challenge myself to make something complex and new to me.
- Hosting a poker night. *(Finally)*

I know that's like a pot-shot rambling wishlist but you get the idea.

### Finally

I have had a wonderful birthday despite the current times, went for a walk around [Studley-Royal](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/fountains-abbey-and-studley-royal-water-garden), made some good food and drank some good whisky...
