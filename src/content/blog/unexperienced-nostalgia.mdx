### TL;DR
I describe a feeling that probably has a better name and ramble about a cabin in the snow...

### There's Gotta Be A Better Name For This?

Do you ever have a feeling of what I think is nostalgia but it's for something you haven't done/experienced?
<br/>
<br/>
For a while now I have wanted to visit northern Scandinavia, specifically in winter when the sun barely rises for several hours.
<br/>
I mean I want to see Scandinavia in general but there's a strong yearning for living in a cabin through the Scandinavian winter with all the facets that come with that like collecting wood, keeping the fire going etc...
<br/>
<br/>
I know it's a daydream or a common fantasy to live in a log cabin in a forest but I think this is something more? the whole Scandinavian way of life is something I like the idea of...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not entirely sure what I'm trying to say or where this stream of consciousness is going.
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the title... ___"Unexperienced Nostalgia"___. Is the best way I can describe this feeling, anyway this video invoked the aforementioned feeling.

### A Feeling...

In Peter Mckinnon's _'The Mountains Won't Remember Me'_ video @1:50min he says:
<br/>
___"There's a loneliness that always surprises me. reminds you how small you are, how small your worries and problems are, I think we all need to be reminded that. you know from time to time..."___
<br/>
He's talking about the feeling he gets when spending time in the mountains.

<br/>
I like that sentiment, it describes exactly what I think the experience would be like.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally to wrap up this unadulterated train of thought that may or may not make any sense, I'll leave you with this question: __Have you ever had '_Unexperienced Nostalgia_'?__
